Title: Uclip Readme

*Uclip v1.22 (released 01/27/13)*

Uclip is a noclip alternative. By this we mean it's similar but different in the fact that you can't noclip
through anything but your own props (If you're running a prop protection). So, you can't noclip through the
world or through others' props. Admins can still noclip through everything.

Group: Authors

Uclip is brought to you by..

* Brett "Megiddo" Smith - Contact: <megiddo@ulyssesmod.net>
* Ryno-SauruS

Group: Requirements

Uclip has no requirements, but it is recommended you use it with a supported prop protector. Supported protectors are below...
* UPS (recommended!)
* Simple Prop Protection
* FPP
* Anything else that supports CPPI (contact the mod author)

Group: Installation

To install Uclip, simply extract the files from the archive to your garrysmod/addons folder.
When you've done this, you should have a file structure like this--
<garrysmod>/addons/uclip/lua/autorun/sh_uclip.lua
etc..

Please note that installation is the same on dedicated servers.

You absolutely, positively have to do a full server restart after installing the files. A simple map
change will not cut it!

Group: Config

There is minimal config inside sh_uclip.lua but you will need basic knowledge of lua to use it.
